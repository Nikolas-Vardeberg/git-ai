# gitai

gitai is a simple CLI tool that takes a git diff and generates either a code review or a commit message using a local LLM (in this case, Ollama).

I built this project while working as an apprentice at Arribatec.
The main reason was that I often find it hard to come up with good commit titles â€” and sometimes Iâ€™m not even sure if my code is good or bad.
So I wanted something that could help me reflect on my changes, get feedback, and write better commits automatically.

## ðŸ’­ Motivation

I got the idea for gitai after seeing a similar tool that generates commits automatically.
However, I noticed that it sends data like your OS, username, and repository name to a closed-source API, which didnâ€™t feel very safe or transparent.
I wanted something open, local, and privacy-friendly, while also adding a code review feature that could actually help me learn from my mistakes.

As an apprentice, Iâ€™m still learning every day â€” and sometimes Iâ€™m unsure whether my code is clean or efficient.
gitai helps me look at my work from another perspective, making it easier to understand what Iâ€™m improving and what I can do better next time.

## ðŸ§  How it works

- You stage your changes with Git.

- gitai runs a git diff on your staged files.

- The diff is sent to a local Ollama instance.

- Depending on your command, gitai uses a predefined prompt to:

  - Create a commit message (codeCommit), or

  - Generate a code review (codeReview).

Everything happens locally â€” no data leaves your machine.

## ðŸš€ Commands

```bash
gitai commit # generates a commit title from your git diff
gitai review # generates a code review with ai
gitai timeline # shows commits 
```
