You are an expert at writing Git commit titles.

Your ONLY task is to write **one short, single-line Git commit title**.

### RULES (follow these exactly)
1. Output ONLY the commit title — absolutely **no explanations, no formatting, no markdown, no punctuation around it**.
2. Do NOT use quotes (" "), backticks (\` \`), or any kind of brackets.
3. Use **Conventional Commit** format (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:, chore:, docs:, style:, etc.).
4. Write in a **formal** tone.
5. Keep it **short** (under ~10 words).
6. Do NOT include file names, code, variables, or underscores.
7. The result must look like this (example):  
   feat: improve user authentication flow  
   ✅ Correct  
   ❌ "feat: improve user authentication flow"  
   ❌ \`feat: improve user authentication flow\`  
   ❌ feat: improve user authentication flow - updated user.go

### Configuration
- Conventional commits: true
- Use emojis: false
- Tone: formal
- Length: short

### Input
git diff:
${gitDiff}

### Output
Now write ONLY the Git commit title — one single line, plain text, no quotes or formatting:`;

export const CreateReviewPrompt = (
  gitDiff: string
) => `Code Review Expert: Detailed Analysis and Best Practices

As a senior software engineer with expertise in code quality, security, and performance optimization, perform a code review of the provided git diff.

Focus on delivering actionable feedback in the following areas:

Critical Issues:

Security vulnerabilities and potential exploits

Runtime errors and logic bugs

Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

Memory management and resource utilization

Threading and concurrency issues

Input validation and error handling

Code Quality:

Adherence to language-specific conventions and best practices

Design patterns and architectural considerations

Code organization and modularity

Naming conventions and code readability

Documentation completeness and clarity

Test coverage and testing approach

Maintainability:

Code duplication and reusability

Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity)

Dependencies and coupling

Extensibility and future-proofing

Technical debt implications

Provide specific recommendations with:

Code examples for suggested improvements

References to relevant documentation or standards

Rationale for suggested changes

Impact assessment of proposed modifications

Format your review using clear sections and bullet points. Include inline code references where applicable.

Note: This review should comply with the project's established coding standards and architectural guidelines.

Constraints

IMPORTANT: Use git --no-pager diff --no-prefix --unified=100000 --minimal $(git merge-base main --fork-point)...head to get the diff for code review.

In the provided git diff, if the line starts with + or -, it means that the line is added or removed. If the line starts with a space, it means that the line is unchanged. If the line starts with @@, it means that the line is a hunk header.

Avoid overwhelming the developer with too many suggestions at once.

Use clear and concise language to ensure understanding.

Assume suppressions are needed like #pragma warning disable and don't include them in the review.

If there are any TODO comments, make sure to address them in the review.

Use markdown for each suggestion, like:

Code Review

Should example of what the code could look like after applying the fix.

Suggestions
code_review_emoji Summary of the suggestion, include necessary context to understand suggestion}

Priority: priority: (🔥/⚠️/🟡/🟢)

File: relative/path/to/file

Details: ...

Example (if applicable): ...

Suggested Change (if applicable): (code snippet...)

(other suggestions...)
Summary
Use the following emojis to indicate priority:

🔥 Critical

⚠️ High

🟡 Medium

🟢 Low

Each suggestion should be prefixed with an emoji to indicate the type of suggestion:

🔧 Change request

❓ Question

⛏️ Nitpick

♻️ Refactor suggestion

💭 Thought process or concern

👍 Positive feedback

📝 Explanatory note or fun fact

🌱 Observation for future consideration

Always use file paths.

Use Code Review Emojis

Use code review emojis to give added context and clarity for follow-up. For example, use 🔧 for required changes, ⛏ for nitpicky comments, 📌 for follow-ups, 👍 for praise, and 🤔 for considerations.

Emoji Legend
Emoji	Code	Meaning
🔧	:wrench:	Use when this needs to be changed. A concern or suggested change/refactor worth addressing.
❓	:question:	Use for a well-formed question needing a response.
⛏	:pick:	Nitpick. Stylistic or minor issue; often best handled via linting.
♻️	:recycle:	Refactor suggestion. Should be actionable and not nitpicky.
💭	:thought_balloon:	Express concern or alternative solution.
👍	:+1:	Highlight positive code aspects.
📝	:memo:	Explanatory note or relevant commentary.
🌱	:seedling:	Observation or suggestion with long-term implications.
